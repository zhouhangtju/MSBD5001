# running process
  You can just run my lightgbm.ipynb step by step, finally you can obtain the predicting result, and the predicting result is written in the lgbresult.csv file.
I used two datasets for training, one is train.csv from Kaggle, the other is feature.csv which contains some weather datasets.
The trained model is saved in "lgb_reg2feature_best.dat"
